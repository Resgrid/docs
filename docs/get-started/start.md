# Start

Resgrid has multiple options to start using the system. Start here to determine what path you want to go down.

## Hosted

If you do not want to host Resgrid on your own equipment or your own services you can use our hosted version. The hosted version of Resgrid is maintained by the creators of the code-base and is the cutting-edge of the development pipeline. Changes that are made are deployed there first.
