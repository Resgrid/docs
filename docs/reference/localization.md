# Localization

Resgrid's website and applications can support multiple languages. 

## Current Supported Languages

- US English

## Unsupported Languages

We will be unable to support any Right-To-Left languages, for example Arabic, in the system at this time.

## Localization Gaps

The following areas or parts of the system may not be properly localized for your specific language:

- Date and Time Displays
- Number Formats
- Some warnings, error dialog, popups

We are working on improving the localization experience for dynamic and server generated content (i.e. warnings, errors) and the other areas noted above.

## Multi-lingual Documentation and Support

Our technical documentation, help and support channels are US English only. We are unable to translate the documentations or provide support in any other language at this time.
