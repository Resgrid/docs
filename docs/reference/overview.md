# Overview

The goal of the Resgrid project is to have a complete, all-in-one solution that organizations of any size can utilize to manage the intersection of dispatches, personnel and resources. Being a complete solution does not mean it's 'best of breed' for the individual modules (i.e. shifts), as such we want to target a minimum level of functionality for each module and a level of customization to make Resgrid malleable out of the box.

- Easy to Use
- Support Orgs of any size
- Built-in modules to cover __minimum__ functionality or APIs to allow external interactions
- Configurable without knowing how to code
- Can run in a completely air-gapped/offline environment

## Platform

Resgrid has many components that interact with each other at a high level.
