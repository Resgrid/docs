# Documents

The Documents systems allows you to upload and store documents in Resgrid that you want shared with your entire department.

To view or download the document, you would click the file icon in the item (the Green box highlighted below). If you wanted to Edit the file you would click the name (highlighted in the Blue box below). You can only Edit a document if you are a Department Admin or have rights to Create Documents (and you created the document).
