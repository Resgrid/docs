# Setup Department

To get started setting up your department in Resgrid you will need to collect some information first and have that handy as you work through the screens. The information is:

- Department Name, Main Address (Must be a street Address), response area center coordinates (in decimal format)
- Group Names (either stations which require a physical address or organizational that don't have an address)
