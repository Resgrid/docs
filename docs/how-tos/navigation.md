# Suite Navigation

The main website (web application) for Resgrid has a few navigation design patterns that you can see throughout all the pages.

## Web application (Dashboard/homepage) Page

This is the first page you see after logging into the website/web app. The content may change as we update, but the navigational paradigm (the highlighted area) should be consistent.

## Department Menu

The Department menu will be named after your department and is a drop down. If you are a department admin or managing member (the overall owner of the department) you will see the admin options, normal users will just see the options under that.

## Profile Menu

Profile menu is in your name under your profile picture that allows you to edit your own profile and view and join departments or set your active department.
